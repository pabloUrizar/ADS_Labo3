### 1. Run the following commands and tell where stdout and stderr are redirected to.  
> a. ./out > file  
​
stdout is redirected to the file. stderr still points to the command prompt.  
> b. ./out 2> file   
​
stdout still points to the command prompt. stderr is redirected to the file.   
> c. ./out > file 2>&1   
 
stdout is redirected to the file. stderr is redirected to stdout, thus to the file, so both to the file.  
> d. ./out 2>&1 > file  
 
First, stderr is redirected to stdout, thus to the command prompt. Then stdout is redirected to the file but stderr is still pointing to the command prompt.  
> e. ./out &> file  
 
stdout and stderr are both redirected to the file.   
​ 

### 2. What do the following commands do?
> a. cat /usr/share/doc/nano/README | grep -i edit

It will display the lines that contain the word "edit" in the provided README file

> b. ./out 2>&1 | grep –i eeeee

stderr will be redirected to stdout so both will be displayed in the command prompt. From the obtained result, we will keep only the lines that contain "eeeee".

> c. ./out 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep –i eeeee

stderr will be redirected to stdout but it does not change anything because stderr was alread directed to the command prompt output. Then, only the lines that contain "eeeee" will be displayed.

### 3. Write commands to perform the following tasks:

## Task 2: Log analysis


## Task 3: Conversion to CSV
