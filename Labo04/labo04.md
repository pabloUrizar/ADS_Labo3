## Task 2: Create thumbnails  

### Show dimensions script
>Write a script called show_dimensions that loops through all the picture files
and shows for each its name and its dimensions. For the loop use the for .. in
.. do .. done control structure.  

```  
#!/bin/bash
#
# Description : Print the name of each picture in the lab04_raw_files directory, followed by its dimensions. Picture extension should be .png or -jpg. Dimensions are width and height.
#

path=lab04_raw_files
cd $path

for file in *.png *.jpg
do
        echo -e $(identify -format '%f width: %w, height: %h' $file)
done
```  

### Rename pictures script
>Write a script called rename_pictures that produces picture files that have
the dimensions in their name. For example if a picture is called building.jpg
and has a width of 1024 and a height of 768 pixels the script should create a
file building_1024_768.jpg . The script should not modify the original files,
but create new ones.

```
#!/bin/bash
#
# Description : Renames each picture with png or jpg extention. The resulting name is the  name followed by the width and the height of this picture.

mkdir renamed_pictures

cd lab04_raw_files

for picture in *.png *.jpg
do
        picture_ext=${picture##*.}
        name=${picture%%[.]*}
        dimension=$(identify -format '%w_%h' $picture)
        filename=${name}_${dimension}.${picture_ext}

        echo "new name : $filename"
        cp $picture ../renamed_pictures/${filename}
done
```

        name=${file%%.*}

        if [ "${name##*_}" = "thumb" ]
        then
                echo "$name is already a thumbnail"
        elif [ "$ext" = "pdf" ]
        then
                convert -geometry 300 ${file}[0] ${name}_thumb.png
        else
                convert -geometry 300 $file ${name}_thumb.${ext}
        fi
